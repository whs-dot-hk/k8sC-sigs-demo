The reason for this is if the source document moves, the destination document will still have the correct link. It also allows your links to work properly in your own fork of the repo.</p>\n<pre><code>For more information, check out [this](/contributor/guide/document-3.md) document.\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>If you are linking to a file in another kubernetes repo, then use of the git.k8s.io shortener is preferred over a direct github link.
