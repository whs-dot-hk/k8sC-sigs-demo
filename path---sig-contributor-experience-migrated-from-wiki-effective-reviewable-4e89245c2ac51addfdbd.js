As you discover new cool features and workflows, add them here. Once we have built up a good number of tricks we can reorganize this list.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Hold off on publishing comments (using the "Publish" button) until you have completed your review. <a href="@pwittrock">(source)</a></li>\n<li>When leaving comments, select a "disposition" (the button with your profile picture) to indicate whether the comment requires resolution, or is just advisory and hence requires no response. <a href="@pwittrock">(source)</a></li>\n<li>Change a comment\'s "disposition" to "close" those to which the author didn\'t respond explicitly but did address with satisfactory changes to the code. Otherwise, the comment hangs out there awaiting a response; in contrast to GitHub\'s review system, <em>Reviewable</em> doesn\'t consider a change to the target line to be a sufficient indicator of resolution or obsolescence, which is a safer design. Use the <kbd>y</kbd> to acknowledge the current comment, which indicates that no further response is necessary.</li>\n<li>To "collapse" a whole file in the multi-file view, click the rightmost value in the revision range control. This is effectively saying, "Show no diffs."</li>\n<li>Use the red/green "eye" icon to indicate completion of and to keep track of which files you have reviewed. The <kbd>x</kbd> keyboard shortcut toggles the completion status of the file currently focused in the status bar across the top.</li>\n<li>Use the <kbd>p</kbd> and <kbd>n</kbd> keys to navigate to the previous and next unreviewed fileâ€”that is, those whose status is a red circle with a crossed white eye icon, meaning incomplete, as opposed to those with a green circle with a white eye, meaning complete.</li>\n<li>Use the <kbd>j</kbd> and <kbd>k</kbd> keys to navigate to the previous and next comment. Use <kbd>S-j</kbd> and <kbd>S-k</kbd> to navigate between the previous and next <em>unaddressed</em> comment. Usually as the reviewer, you use the latter to go back and check on whether your previous suggestions were addressed.</li>\n<li>Reply with <code>+lgtm</code> to apply the "LGTM" label directly from <em>Reviewable</em>.</li>\n</ul>'},site:{siteMetadata:{sigs:["sig-api-machinery","sig-apps","sig-architecture","sig-auth","sig-autoscaling","sig-aws","sig-azure","sig-big-data","sig-cli","sig-cloud-provider","sig-cluster-lifecycle","sig-cluster-ops","sig-contributor-experience","sig-docs","sig-gcp","sig-ibmcloud","sig-instrumentation","sig-multicluster","sig-network","sig-node","sig-openstack","sig-product-management","sig-release","sig-scalability","sig-scheduling","sig-service-catalog","sig-storage","sig-testing","sig-ui","sig-vmware","sig-windows"]}}},pathContext:{slug:"/sig-contributor-experience/migrated-from-wiki/effective-reviewable/"}}}});
