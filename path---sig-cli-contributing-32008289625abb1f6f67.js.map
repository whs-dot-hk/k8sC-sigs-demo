Pick up an\\nissue that fits your experience level and interest.  Documentation and\\ntest-coverage issues typically are smaller in scope and easier to complete than\\nfeatures and cleanup issues.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>\\n<p><code>type/code-cleanup</code></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Usually some refactoring or small rewrites of code.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><code>type/code-documentation</code></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Write <code>doc.go</code> with package overview and examples or add code comments to document\\nexisting types and functions.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><code>type/code-feature</code></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Usually a new go package / library for some functionality that is requested.\\nShould be encapsulated in its own interfaces with thorough unit tests for the new library.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n<li>\\n<p><code>type/code-test-coverage</code></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Audit tests for a package.  Run coverage tools and also manually look at what functions\\nare missing unit or integration tests.  Write tests for these functions.</li>\\n</ul>\\n</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p><strong>Provide periodic status updates</strong></p>\\n<p>Once you have requested an issue and it has been accepted, you will be expected\\nto provide periodic updates to it.  Do update the issue with your status at least every\\nweek, and publish your work to a fork so the community can see your progress and\\nprovide early feedback.</p>\\n<p>If you find the issue is too challenging, time consuming, or you are no longer able to work on it,\\nthis is perfectly acceptable and please let the issue author know.\\nIf you like, you may pick up a different issue immediately or sometime in the future.</p>\\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Don't pick up an issue until you are ready to start working on it</li>\\n<li>When you want to pick up an issue, be sure to comment <code>@seans3</code> and <code>@mengqiy</code>.\\nExpect a response within 2 days.</li>\\n<li>Update the issue every week with your progress so we know it is being actively worked on.</li>\\n<li>There is an expectation that some time will be committed to working on the issue each\\nweek until it is completed, or you are blocked on a maintainer.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Meet the community</h3>\\n<p>Engage with the SIG cli community!

Do update the issue with your status at least every\\nweek, and publish your work to a fork so the community can see your progress and\\nprovide early feedback.</p>\\n<p>If you find the issue is too challenging, time consuming, or you are no longer able to work on it,\\nthis is perfectly acceptable and please let the issue author know.\\nIf you like, you may pick up a different issue immediately or sometime in the future.</p>\\n<p><strong>Summary</strong>:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Don't pick up an issue until you are ready to start working on it</li>\\n<li>When you want to pick up an issue, be sure to comment <code>@seans3</code> and <code>@mengqiy</code>.\\nExpect a response within 2 days.</li>\\n<li>Update the issue every week with your progress so we know it is being actively worked on.</li>\\n<li>There is an expectation that some time will be committed to working on the issue each\\nweek until it is completed, or you are blocked on a maintainer.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Meet the community</h3>\\n<p>Engage with the SIG cli community!
