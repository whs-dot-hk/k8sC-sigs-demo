Tools like Docker and Kubernetes make it incredibly easy to do this, however, knowing when your stack is outdated or vulnerable and starting the upgrade process is still a manual step. Stacksmith is a service that aims to solve this by maintaining your base Dockerfiles and proactively keeping them up-to-date and secure. This demo walked through how you can use Stacksmith with your application on GitHub to provide continuous delivery of your application container images.</li>\n<li>Adnan is available as @prydonius on the Kubernetes slack as well as on <a href="https://twitter.com/prydonius">twitter</a> for questions and feedback.</li>\n<li>Feel free to leave feedback on the <a href="https://stacksmith.bitnami.com/">Stacksmith</a> feedback tab.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Matt Farina gave an update on the SIG-Apps survey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can find a list of the current questions <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1d4P_-lNGzw4jS9T4iizQBOtWT4O6e5yjDUygINigJnA/edit#gid=0">here</a> in a view only state.</li>\n<li>If you are interested in submitting questions or being a part of the team that collects/analyzes the data, please reach out to @mattfarina on the Kubernetes slack channel.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Michelle Noorali gave an update on where you can find information and examples on PetSets. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Here are some links provided by Pranshanth from Google.</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/260#issuecomment-220395798">github issue</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://git.k8s.io/contrib/pets">example pets</a></li>\n<li>Feel free to get your hands dirty.
