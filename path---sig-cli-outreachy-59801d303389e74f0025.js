Kubernetes builds upon 15 years of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.\nPlease see <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">kubernetes.io</a> for more details.</p>\n<h2>What are SIGs / What is SIG-CLI?</h2>\n<p>Kubernetes is a set of projects, each shepherded by a special interest group (SIG). To get a grasp of the projects that we work on, check out the complete <a href="/k8s-c-sigs-demo/sig-list.md">list of SIGs</a>.\nThis <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1JqcALpsg07eH665ZXQrIvOcin6SzzsIUjMRRVivrZMg">slide deck</a> provides an overview of how the Kubernetes community is organized.</p>\n<p>SIG-CLI Covers kubectl and related tools. We focus on the development and standardization of the CLI framework and its dependencies, the establishment of conventions for writing CLI commands, POSIX compliance, and improving the command line tools from a developer and devops user experience and usability perspective.  </p>\n<p><strong>Communication:</strong></p>\n<p>SIG-CLI Mailing List - kubernetes-sig-cli@googlegroups.com\nSlack - <a href="http://slack.k8s.io/">http://slack.k8s.io/</a> for invite; #sig-cli channel</p>\n<p><strong>Mentors</strong></p>\n<p>Philip Wittrock - pwittrock@google.com\nSimilar to contacting the coordinators, the mentors can be contacted at any time either by sending messages to the mailing lists or slack channels.</p>\n<h2>Contribute</h2>\n<p>As part of the application process, the Outreachy program recommends that candidates make small contributions to the project they intend to apply for.\nTo start working on the project, make sure to fill out the <a href="/k8s-c-sigs-demo/CLA.md">CLA</a> and check if you have the right environment with this guide.\nThe README in the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/community">community repo</a> details these things and more.</p>\n<p>Check out these specific resources for how to contribute to CLI:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>SIG-CLI - <a href="/k8s-c-sigs-demo/sig-cli/CONTRIBUTING.md">How to Contribute</a></li>\n<li>Filter issue search for: <code>is:open is:issue label:sig/cli label:"help wanted"</code></li>\n<li>Hand picked issues for outreachy applications: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/projects/3">https://github.com/kubernetes/kubectl/projects/3</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Available tasks</h2>\n<p>Develop <code>kubectl create</code> commands to make it easy to create Kubernetes resources<br>\nDevelop <code>kubectl set</code> commands to modify Kubernetes resources<br>\nRequired Skills: Go<br>\nMentor: Phillip Wittrock</p>\n<p><strong>Coordination:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Paris Pittman - parispittman@google.com</li>\n<li>Josh Berkus</li>\n<li>Elsie Phillips</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The coordinators can be contacted at any time.
