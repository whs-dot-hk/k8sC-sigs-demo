Pod manifest, service manifest, etc are also created.</li>\n<li>Q: Is slugbuilder a separate microservice others can use?\nA: Yes. It\'s a plugin to <a href="https://github.com/deis/builder">builder</a> that can be used with other builders as well. For example, there is some way to incorporate an object store for storage of images.</li>\n<li>Q: How does Deis use namespaces?\nA: There is a separate one for each application. Then other tools can deploy supporting services to the same namespace.</li>\n<li>Q: What languages are used in Deis?\nA: Rails, Phoenix, Django, some PHP, and node are examples of apps today. There are currently not many Go applications.</li>\n<li>Q: Will Deis add back-end services?\nA: Can\'t really say. They are getting plenty of requests for them. This may be a place helm will step in and be useful.</li>\n<li>Deis 2.2 adds the ability to use Deployments which was showcased. This is optional and not the default right now.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Matt presented the results of the App Operator survey.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The raw details are available to <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15SUL7QTpR4Flrp5eJ5TR8A5ZAFwbchfX2QL4MEoJFQ8/edit?usp=sharing">view or download</a>.</li>\n<li>A roll-up of some interesting points is <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/13votPnx9xKVBoQbLHz78I9EWFCosoioFqjTFeb4vB6M/edit?usp=sharing">available</a>.</li>\n<li>The use of Kubernetes secrets was discussed. 47% of respondents use secrets. Secrets current storage mechanism is unencrypted at rest. This is a known limitation and we are waiting for some in the community to step in and provide support for systems like Hashicorp Vault or hardware security modules where appropriate.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note, due to technical difficulties this meeting was not recorded.</em></p>'},site:{siteMetadata:{sigs:["sig-api-machinery","sig-apps","sig-architecture","sig-auth","sig-autoscaling","sig-aws","sig-azure","sig-big-data","sig-cli","sig-cloud-provider","sig-cluster-lifecycle","sig-cluster-ops","sig-contributor-experience","sig-docs","sig-gcp","sig-ibmcloud","sig-instrumentation","sig-multicluster","sig-network","sig-node","sig-openstack","sig-product-management","sig-release","sig-scalability","sig-scheduling","sig-service-catalog","sig-storage","sig-testing","sig-ui","sig-vmware","sig-windows"]}}},pathContext:{slug:"/sig-apps/minutes/2016-07-27/"}}}});
